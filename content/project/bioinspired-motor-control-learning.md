Using machine learning techniques, weâ€™ve succeeded in enabling robots to receive a message and then find out for themselves how to solve the task. Here, we utilize the ability of the cerebellum to learn from its mistakes so that it achieves the desired action

We developed a new bio-inspired control system for robots based on the human cerebellum. The cerebellum controls our movements and adjusts them to the surroundings, both in relation to activating the right muscles

Results:

The experiments involved a musculoskeletal mouse robot. It was made to walk on two rolling belts, one for each hindlimb. The speed of one of the belt was then increased, and the robot automatically adjusted the walking parameters to stabilize the movement. These provisional findings confirm the results achieved under similar tests with real mice and humans.
