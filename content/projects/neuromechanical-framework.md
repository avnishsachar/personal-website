We investigated locomotion control in undulatory animals and transitions between different environmental media. Its objective was to test the idea that a single control principle could explain different modes of locomotion in vertebrate and invertebrate animals for different morphologies in different environmental media.

I thus created a neuromechnical framework on Robot Operating System (ROS) and Gazebo to test the hypothesis.The neuromechanical framework was developed to test our controllers for models in complex environments, including the simulation of rough terrain, water, sand and mud. This was important for verifying that the controllers developed can work at different scales ranging from the animals to the robot experiments, and would thus allow to insure that the final single control principle that we are aimed to achieve can work on a continuum of morphologies with different shapes, masses and sizes.

I developed plotting tools to help analyze locomotion data like step-length, phase frequency, gait shape, and more real-time.
