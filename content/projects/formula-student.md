[Formula Manipal](https://www.formulamanipal.in/) is a Formula Student (FSAE) team with an aim to design, conceptualize, fabricate, test and race a single seater, open-wheel Formula Style race car. I worked as an Electronics Engineer on the team. 

Data Acquisition (DAq) and Telemetry: Designed and deployed a DAq system using LabVIEW. Loggedtemperatures, pressures, acceleration, braking, wheel speed, and battery data amongst others to analyze telemetryand guide the design and development of the car.

Paddle Shifting Gearbox and Drag Reduction System (DRS): I implemented a electro-pneumatic closedloop gear-shifting and clutching system capable of shifting the carâ€™s transmission within 200ms.  Developed aautomatic DRS for the aerodynamic package of the car
