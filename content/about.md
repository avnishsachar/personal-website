I am a Robotics Graduate student at [Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI)](www.wpi.edu). I am passionate about tackling hard problems in autonomy (specifically control and planning) and help advance the future of robotics to improve everyday lives.

Currently, I am working with [Prof. Jing Xiao](http://users.wpi.edu/~jxiao2/) at Adaptive and Intelligent Robotics (AIR) Lab, WPI. My research focuses on developing real-time motion planning and controls algorithms for robot navigation in dynamically-changing environments. I am also working on developing a robotic endoscope at [PracticePoint](https://www.wpi.edu/research/core-research-facilities/practicepoint), WPI in collaboration with [Boston Scientific](https://www.bostonscientific.com/en-US/Home.html).

I am skilled in C++ and Python for programming, frameworks like PyTorch for Deep Learning, ROS for robotics, and Linux for development. I hold a B.S. degree in Mechatronics and have previously worked as a ML engineer at a robotics startup, as a research intern at leading neuro-robotics labs, and as an engineer on my university’s Formula Student (FSAE) team. I occasionally participate in hackathons in my free time, having placed 3rd in an international hackathon organized at the Microsoft Development Center in Copenhagen (Copenhacks’19).

I am a multidisciplinary person by nature as my interests include programming, urban design, research, and consumer-focused products and I love designing entire systems from the ground up! I’m currently looking for internship opportunities for Summer’21 with a product-focused organization missioned at delivering autonomous solutions.
